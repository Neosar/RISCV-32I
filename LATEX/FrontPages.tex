I would like to thank my thesis advisor, \underline{Aristides Efthymiou} for all his help and support. His door was always open whenever I needed some assistance or some clarification on a certain matter.\par
Also, I deeply thank professor \underline{Chrysovalantis Kavousianos} for providing me with all the study material and his useful opinions on my work when they were needed. \par
Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and friends for their endless patience and support they've given me those past few months.
