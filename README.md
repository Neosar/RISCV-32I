# RISC-V 32-bit Base ISA Implementation. 

### About the Project
The design and the implementation of this RV32I ISA was the subject of my Integrated Master's Degree Thesis at Computer Science and Engineering (University of Ioannina). The project began at mid-January and finished at June of the same year (2019). 
My work was supervised by professor [Aristides Efthymiou](http://www.cse.uoi.gr/~efthym/Site/Welcome.html).

### Short Introduction About the Project's Development
The whole project was developed hierarchically using VHDL and every part
was designed, so that it could be synthesizable. In fact, most of the modules
we created for the needs of the project were also tested on Altera’s Cyclone II
\- DE 2 FPGA Board. Concerning the evaluation methods used, we ran various
simulations using ModelSim and Quartus-II’s embedded simulator. Finally, the
complete design was successfully tested, using the official tests designated for
this ISA (RV32I)
